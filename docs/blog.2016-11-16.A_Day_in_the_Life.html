      <h2>A Day in the Life</h2>
<p><em>Posted on 2016-11-16.</em></p>
<h4>Tags: Gastroparesis, Mental Illness, Mental Health, Bodily Functions, Spoon Theory</h4>
<p>Today I am hungry.  Today I am nauseous.</p>
<p>I was thinking about it just now, and I’ve never really considered how different my life is now that I’m sick and have been diagnosed.  Obviously, life has changed.  You don’t gain a chronic illness and go back to life as usual unless you are very very lucky.  Illness almost always has a permanent effect on you and your way of life, and you don’t realize it until you get sick.</p>
<p>Which is actually why I’m writing this.  As I said in my previous post, most of my friends consider me cured.  I seem to live a normal life, I seem mentally and physically able bodied, and I seem happy.  I am none of those things.  If you are unfamiliar with the Spoon Theory, now would be a good time to google it.</p>
<p>Take today for example.  This morning I woke up extra nauseous.  This morning at precisely 1:34 am.  I know the time because I grabbed my phone on the way to the bathroom, expecting to be in there waiting to vomit for a while.  However, as soon as I got out of bed and walked to my bedroom door, the sensation vanished completely.  I shrugged and got back into bed, spent a little time getting comfortable and started drifting back to sleep.</p>
<p>This is a completely normal occurrence.</p>
<p>Most nights, it stops there and I simply sleep for the rest of the night.  Otherwise, what happens next is a series of unfortunate events.  I spent the next few hours of the morning almost falling asleep, waking up to nausea or abdominal cramps, walking to the bathroom door, and going back to bed without ever actually entering the bathroom.  It is now 5:24 am.  I am excessively tired and finally fall asleep until my alarm goes off at 7:00 am.  I have gotten about 4 hours of actual sleep.</p>
<p>This is a completely normal night.</p>
<p>This series doesn’t happen every night, or even most nights.  It’s a number somewhere between a third and half.  Not enough for my doctors to consider it a problem, but enough to have entered into my new normal.  You’ll notice I didn’t mention any form of the words “confusion” or “frustration” in that description.  Because on these nights I don’t feel those emotions.  I go into autopilot and walk about my “morning routine” as much as necessary until my body feels like allowing me to sleep, and then I do.</p>
<p>I should say here that I don’t ever actually vomit.  Though one of the symptoms of gastroparesis is excessive vomiting, my version doesn’t give me that relief.  I’m told this is normal.  I’m also told the people who spend most of their days vomiting don’t get any relief from the action anyway.  That is to say, vomiting doesn’t make the nausea any better.  At any rate, I don’t actually vomit.  I just go to the bathroom as a safety precaution.  </p>
<p>Anyway, it is now 7:00 am, I have gotten 4ish hours of sleep and I have about an hour and a half to get ready for school.  My first action is to take two pills, one for nausea and one for anxiety.  I then assess the results of the previous night’s activities.  I didn’t sleep enough and am therefore too nauseous to eat breakfast.  This will trigger my anxiety.  If I eat, I will be more nauseous, experience extreme abdominal pains, and later likely have diarrhea.  My morning nausea pill will do almost nothing today.  I have to take it anyway.  It keeps my digestive system stimulated and because of it maybe I will get lunch later.  I get up to make tea, set an alarm for about an hour, and lay back down to rest.  This hour is the one I normally spend eating breakfast, showering, doing makeup, and any other things I do on good days.  Because today is a bad day, I have fewer spoons and need the extra rest.</p>
<p>Now here’s the kicker.  All bad nights result in bad days, but not all bad days are a result of bad nights.  That is to say a third to half of my nights are bad, but a little over half of my days are bad.  I don’t always get the warning.</p>
<p>The rest of the day follows a similar pattern.  I go to class and attempt to pay attention despite wanting to fall back asleep in my chair.  At lunch time, I take a second nausea pill and reassess.  I am tired, anxious, still too nauseous to eat, and running out of spoons.  After noon some time, my body realizes I haven’t consumed anything but tea since I woke up and my stomach starts growling.  I am still too nauseous to eat.  I have to let it grumble and move on with the day.  This will trigger my anxiety.  I work on school work.  I don’t get to take a nap.  I take pills for anxiety and depression.  I reassess.  I am very tired, my attention is wandering, my stomach is growling, I am nauseous, and I am out of spoons.  </p>
<p>I have one class left to attend.  </p>
<p>If I attend class tonight I will sit in a chair for an hour and a half daydreaming.  If I don’t attend class, it will be the third time in a row I have missed that class.  Both will trigger my anxiety.  Either way I will be tired, my mind will be wandering, my stomach will be growling, I will be nauseous and anxious, and I will be into tomorrow’s spoons.  I will reassess after class.  I will take my nausea pill.  I will likely still be too nauseous to eat.  My hands will start shaking if they haven’t already.  This will trigger my anxiety.  I will take a bevy of pills for nausea, depression, and anxiety and attempt to sleep.  I will end the day exhausted, mind numb, shaking, anxious, stomach growling, and out of spoons for tomorrow as well.  </p>
<p>And I will be nauseous.</p>
<p>This is a completely normal day.</p>

			<br />
			<div>One thing to know about Amy is that she feels really weird about talking about herself in the third person. So she's not going to do that in this section. Hi, I am Amy. I enjoy writing and reading, my favorite books include knights and magic and medieval times, my favorites of my own stories are about vampires and romance, and it's been a long time since I've written creatively, but I will soon. I have a degree in English from UC Berkeley, and I plan on eventually getting more. I would like to eventually be a teacher or an author or both, but for now I'm settling for a recovering sick person. Welcome to my blog, and welcome to my world. </div>
