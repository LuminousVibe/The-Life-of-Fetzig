      <h2>About Me and This Website</h2>
<p>I was born on November 9th of a year I will not specify.  For most of my life, I've been fairly normal and healthy.  I did well in school, got accepted into the accelerated programs at all levels, took some Advanced Placement classes and eventually graduated with a respectable GPA and many college prospects.</p>
<p>Midway through June of 2013, in the middle of college finals prep, I woke up nauseous and no one knew why.</p>
<p>In March of 2015, after two years of tests and failed diagnoses, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Obsessive Compulsive tendencies, and Severe Depression with no suicidal tendencies.  </p>
<p>In May of 2015 I was accepted to The University of California Berkeley.  </p>
<p>In August of 2015 I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis.</p>
<p>Gastroparesis is the weakening or total paralysis of the stomach muscles, and parts of the intestines in my case.  The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach and abdominal pains, constipation, acid reflux, loss of appetite, and weight loss among others.  It can be caused by diabetes, cancer, botched abdominal surgeries, certain auto-immune disorders, complications of viral infections, and old age.  I have all of those symptoms and none of those causes.  I fall into the 10-15% of cases that present idiopathic.  No known cause.  No known cure.  The only treatments are certain medications that can speed the emptying of the stomach, block nausea receptors in the brain, and calm the stomach acid.</p>
<p>Now, after college has ended and job hunting has begun, I also have this.  A place to come with my struggles and anxieties. I guess, while accepting the risk of sounding cheesy, I hope to help others like me.  This battle has encompassed me, body and mind. I want to connect with others like me, and educate those who don't know what we go through.</p>
<p>So here I am.</p>
<p>And I am not alone.</p>

			<br />
			<div>One thing to know about Amy is that she feels really weird about talking about herself in the third person. So she's not going to do that in this section. Hi, I am Amy. I enjoy writing and reading, my favorite books include knights and magic and medieval times, my favorites of my own stories are about vampires and romance, and it's been a long time since I've written creatively, but I will soon. I have a degree in English from UC Berkeley, and I plan on eventually getting more. I would like to eventually be a teacher or an author or both, but for now I'm settling for a recovering sick person. Welcome to my blog, and welcome to my world. </div>
